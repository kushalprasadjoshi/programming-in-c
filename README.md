# Programming in C - Complete Course Notes

![Status: Inactive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Inactive-red)

A structured repository for **Pokhara University's C Programming course** (CMP 124). Contains theory, code examples, practical labs, and project work to help students master C programming from basics to advanced concepts. This work is an independent effort by **Kushal Prasad Joshi**, inspired by the curriculum of **Pokhara University**, and is intended to support students in their academic journey. While based on the university's course structure, this work is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by **Pokhara University**.

## ⚙️ Installation
To use these notes and code, you’ll need:
1. A C compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)).
2. A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)).
3. Git (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kushalprasadjoshi/programming-in-c.git
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage
1. Navigate to the [`theory`](./theory/) directory for **unit-wise notes**.
2. Study code examples **directly in each unit’s folder** (e.g., [`01-programming-languages-and-problem-solving`](./theory/01-programming-languages-and-problem-solving/)).
3. Practice with **lab exercises** in the [`practicals`](./practicals/) directory.
